Criminal justice research often requires conversion of free-text offense descriptions into overall charge categories to aid analysis. For example, the free-text offense of "eluding a police vehicle" would be coded to a charge category of "Obstruction - Law Enforcement". Since free-text offense descriptions aren't standardized and often need to be categorized in large volumes, this can result in a manual and time intensive process for researchers. ROTA is a machine learning model for converting offense text into offense codes. 

Currently ROTA predicts the *Charge Category* of a given offense text. A *charge category* is one of the headings for offense codes in the [2009 NCRP Codebook: Appendix F](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/studies/30799/datadocumentation#).

The model was trained on [publicly available data](https://web.archive.org/web/20201021001250/https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NACJD/guides/ncrp.html) from a crosswalk containing offenses from all 50 states combined with three additional hand-labeled offense text datasets.

This model and application were developed by the [RTI International Center for Data Science](https://www.rti.org/centers/rti-center-data-science).
